# Crypto

Welcome to the Cyrpto Gem! You can now check the prices of the top 50 cryptocurrencies in real time in your own terminal! The gem scrapes the data off of www.coinranking.com using Nokogiri and parsed into coin objects that you can call on individually to expand into their data.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'crypto'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install crypto

## Usage

Run the gem by typing in './bin/crypto' into your terminal or console. Enter the number that corresponds to the coin you would like more information about. Type 'list' to bring back the list of coins back to your terminal. Type 'done' to close the application. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
