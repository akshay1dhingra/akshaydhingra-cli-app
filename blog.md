WOW so that was tough. I just spent 3 days trying to set up my local environment on my machine.
I was able to create an SSH key from my home machine and connect that to my github account so that
I can pull clone and push seamlessly. For some reason, my work computer already allows me to do this. it could be because I have IDE already installed on that machine; but makes no sense since I have IDE also installed on my home machine. strange. I will have to follow the same instructions in the setting_up_git_remote.md file on my portable machine. I will update on how that goes.

I am now following Avis step by step video. Its getting late so I hope I can get through at least half of it tonight and finish the video tomorrow morning at work on that machine... lets hope it works!
